# Introduction

This is an example book to showcase Tubaina2 features. It's consisted of simple markdown files organized in the same folder. You can use **any** markdown syntax in here.

It's possible to use code blocks using the backtick syntax from GFM:

```java
public class Main {
	
}
```

It should allow language specific syntax highlight.

```html
<html>
	<title>Page</title>
</html>
```
